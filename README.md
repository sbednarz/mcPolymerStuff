### Tools & plugins for mcPolymer

[mcPolymer](https://www.itc.tu-clausthal.de/mcpolymer/) is Monte Carlo simulation program of free radical polymerization created by Marco Drache, Georg Drache, Benjamin Hosemann and distibuted as free software. [mcPolymer](https://www.itc.tu-clausthal.de/fileadmin/zip/mcPolymer-v3.1.zip) has open architecture and is extremely flexible. It uses TCL scripting language to control simulations.

#### Here is my stuff (compatible with [mcPolymer v3.1](https://www.itc.tu-clausthal.de/fileadmin/zip/mcPolymer-v3.1.zip)):

[McPolymerMap.py](https://github.com/sbednarz/mcPolymerStuff/blob/master/McPolymerMap.py) - Mapping of mcPolymer simulation results directory to a Python dictionary variable


[PLPplugin](https://github.com/sbednarz/mcPolymerStuff/tree/master/PLPplugin) - Pulsed Laser Polymerization (PLP) plugin for mcPolymer. See [examples](https://github.com/sbednarz/mcPolymerStuff/tree/master/PLPplugin/examples) of uses and comparison with results obtained by commercial software (summary [here](https://github.com/sbednarz/mcPolymerStuff/blob/master/PLPplugin/examples/examples.pdf)).
